`@studiocms/ui` is the UI library that we use to build StudioCMS. The library is agnostic, meaning that you can use it
in your own Astro projects! 

To get started, add the integration to your project.

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro add @studiocms/ui" />

<details>
<summary>Using `@studiocms/ui` with Astro 4</summary>

StudioCMS UI can be used in Astro 5 without any additional configuration. As for Astro v4, `@studiocms/ui` requires version `v4.5.0` or higher, with the 
`experimental.directRenderScript` flag turned on.
</details>

## Manual Installation

Install the `@studiocms/ui` package with your preferred package manager.

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@studiocms/ui" />

Import and use the `@studiocms/ui` integration in your Astro config.

```ts showLinenumbers title="astro.config.mjs" {2,6}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import ui from '@studiocms/ui';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    ui()
  ]
});
```

## Importing Components

All components in this library are exported from `@studiocms/ui/components`. You can import and use the components like this:

```astro showLinenumbers title="ButtonExample.astro"
---
import { Button } from 'studiocms:ui/components';
---

<Button />
```

## Using `@studiocms/ui` with Tailwind

If you haven't already, add Astro's Tailwind integration to your project.

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro add tailwind" />

Disable [Tailwind's preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) styles with `applyBaseStyles: false`.

```ts showLinenumbers title="astro.config.mjs" "applyBaseStyles: false"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import ui from '@studiocms/ui';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    ui(),
    tailwind({ applyBaseStyles: false })
  ]
});
```

Create a CSS file for Tailwind's base styles. For example `src/styles/tailwind.css`.

```css showLinenumbers title="src/styles/tailwind.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Import this CSS file in any layout or page that uses Tailwind.

```astro showLinenumbers title="src/layouts/Base.astro"
---
import '../styles/tailwind.css';

// ...
---
```
