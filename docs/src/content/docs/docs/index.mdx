`@studiocms/ui` is the UI library that we use to build StudioCMS. The library is agnostic, meaning that you can use it
in your own Astro projects! 

You can install it from npm:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@studiocms/ui" />

All of these components can be tested in our [UI playground](https://ui-testing.studiocms.dev/) or on the docs right here.

:::note
StudioCMS UI can be used in Astro v5 without any issues. As for Astro v4, we require version `v4.5.0` or higher, with the 
`experimental.directRenderScript` flag turned on. The library might still work with older versions, however we haven't tested 
them and thus cannot guarantee that it works in those versions.
:::

## Importing Components

All components this library are exported from `@studiocms/ui/components`. You can import and use the components like this:

```astro showLinenumbers title="ButtonExample.astro"
---
import { Button } from '@studiocms/ui/components';
---

<Button />
```

Include the styles by importing `@studiocms/ui/css/global.css` in your page layout.

```astro showLinenumbers title="Layout.astro"
---
import '@studiocms/ui/css/global.css';
---
```

:::danger[About Accessibility]
As of right now, `@studiocms/ui` is nowhere near being accessible. We are still missing crucial support for keyboard navigation,
screen readers etc. This is by design, as although this library is publicly accessible, we still focus on building StudioCMS with it.

We will add support for keyboard navigation and screenreaders at a later time, once we perform the planned accessibility audit for StudioCMS.
Should you however want to contribute, and add these features yourself, feel free to!
