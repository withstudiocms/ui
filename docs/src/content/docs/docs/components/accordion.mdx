An accordion component. Used to create small pockets of additional information.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <PreviewCard>
      <Accordion>
        <AccordionItem open>
          <div slot="summary">This is the summary</div>
          <div>These are the details</div>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
          <div slot="summary">This is the 2nd summary</div>
          <div>These are the 2nd details</div>
        </AccordionItem>
      </Accordion>
    </PreviewCard>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    ```astro showLinenumbers title="AccordionExample.astro"
    ---
    import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'studiocms:ui/components';
    ---

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem open>
        <div slot="summary">This is the summary</div>
        <div>These are the details</div>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem>
        <div slot="summary">This is the 2nd summary</div>
        <div>These are the 2nd details</div>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Opening an item by default

You can pass the `open` prop to any `<AccordionItem>` to have it be open by default, as seen above in the example.

### Styles

The accordion component has multiple different styles:

- `outlined` (Default)
- `separated`
- `filled`
- `blank`

They can be used via the `style` prop on the accordion parent. Here's an accordion with the `filled` style:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <PreviewCard>
      <Accordion style="filled">
        <AccordionItem open>
          <div slot="summary">This is the summary</div>
          <div>These are the details</div>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
          <div slot="summary">This is the 2nd summary</div>
          <div>These are the 2nd details</div>
        </AccordionItem>
      </Accordion>
    </PreviewCard>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    ```astro showLinenumbers title="AccordionStyleExample.astro"
    ---
    import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'studiocms:ui/components';
    ---

    <Accordion style="filled">
      <AccordionItem open>
        <div slot="summary">This is the summary</div>
        <div>These are the details</div>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem>
        <div slot="summary">This is the 2nd summary</div>
        <div>These are the 2nd details</div>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Multiple Open Items

By default, users can open multiple items in the accordion at once. You can change this behavior by setting the `multipleOpen` prop on the `<Accordion>` element to false:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <PreviewCard>
      <Accordion multipleOpen={false}>
        <AccordionItem open>
          <div slot="summary">This is the summary</div>
          <div>These are the details</div>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
          <div slot="summary">This is the 2nd summary</div>
          <div>These are the 2nd details</div>
        </AccordionItem>
      </Accordion>
    </PreviewCard>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    ```astro showLinenumbers title="AccordionStyleExample.astro"
    ---
    import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'studiocms:ui/components';
    ---

    <Accordion multipleOpen={false}>
      <AccordionItem open>
        <div slot="summary">This is the summary</div>
        <div>These are the details</div>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem>
        <div slot="summary">This is the 2nd summary</div>
        <div>These are the 2nd details</div>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
