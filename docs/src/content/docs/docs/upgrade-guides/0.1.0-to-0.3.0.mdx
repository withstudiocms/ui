title: From v0.1 to v0.3

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Version 0.3.0 of `@studiocms/ui` introduced mostly accessibility improvements and is backwards compatible. 

While there are no breaking changes, **the method of importing the `global.css` stylesheet in the root layout 
has been deprecated in favor of using the provided integration.**

We recommend doing the following to upgrade your project:

<Steps>
1.  Remove the `global.css` import from your root layout.
    ```astro showlinenumbers del={2} title="Layout.astro"
    ---
    import '@studiocms/ui/css/global.css';
    ---
    ```

2.  Add the following code to your `astro.config.mjs` file:
    ```ts showLinenumbers title="astro.config.mjs" {2,6}
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import ui from '@studiocms/ui';

    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [
        ui()
      ]
    });
    ```
</Steps>

The integration will automatically add the stylesheet to your page.
