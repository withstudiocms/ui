// This is a template test file. Copy this file to create new test files.
// Rename the copied file to match the component or feature being tested,
// following the naming convention: <component-or-feature>-test.astro

// For example, to create a test for a Button component,
// copy this file and rename it to button-test.astro. (ensure the file name is all lowercase)

// Then, update the content of the new file to include the specific tests for that component or feature.
// Utilize the existing '#basic-test' div below to add your functionality and test cases. Add
// additional divs with unique IDs as needed for various test scenarios and states including for
// accessibility testing. (e.g., '#color-test', '#variant-test', '#polymorphic-test', etc.)

// Note: Remember to remove this comment block from the new test file.
