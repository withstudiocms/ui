"@studiocms/ui": minor
---

This version of `@studiocms/ui` includes a lot of improvements to the documentation and components. The most important changes include the move to
an integration-based system and a massive keyboard accessibility overhaul (thanks to [HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo) for the feedback on this)!

### Components

- Added a new `<Tabs />` component based on the tabs on the homepage.
- Updated the `<Card />` component to include a new "filled" style.

### Utilities

- Moved the `ThemeHelper` class to its own category in the docs.

### Accessibility

- Overhauled the keyboard accessibility on all components to make them adhere to the ARIA standards.
